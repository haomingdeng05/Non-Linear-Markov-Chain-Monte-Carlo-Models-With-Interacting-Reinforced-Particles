#### Project description: 
Stochastic approximation (SA) methods are used to solve optimization problems by approximating the roots (or fixed points) of a function h : Θ ⊆ Rd → Rd , especially when the function h is irregular or the space is high- dimensional. We plan to establish limit theorems for a class of SA methods whose dynamics are driven by interacting reinforced random walks (IRRW ). In contrast to typical SA settings, here instead of studying the long-term behavior of a single sequence of approximations, one must consider SA arrays and analyze the behavior of the approxima- tion as both time and the number of particles simultaneously become large. The goal of such schemes is to leverage the interactions between a large number of RRW to construct SA algorithms which explore the state space more efficiently and whose performance is superior to SA algorithms that have no such interactions. Motivated by my recent work in [2], I plan to study a general class of SA arrays with IRRW dynamics that can be used for a large class of optimization problems, and to establish conditions under which a suitable SLLN and CLT hold for the large time and large particle limit.
